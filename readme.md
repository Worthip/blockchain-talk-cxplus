# This is an amended version of "Blockchain: Secret Sauce or Snake Oil?" by Julian Browne - This version was used for True Spotlight session 11th September 2018

It is originally a presentation from a [Cohaesus](https://cohaesus.co.uk/) [tech talk](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/blockchain-secret-sauce-or-snake-oil-tickets-43202281186) aimed at puncturing some of the myths about blockchain. The talk was designed to explain blockchain from first principles to a non-tech audience.

The code snapshot from the night can be found at https://github.com/cohaesus/blockchain-talk   
And an ongoing version at https://github.com/julianbrowne/blockchain-talk
